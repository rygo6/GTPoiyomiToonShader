# GTPoiyomiToonShader

If you are downloading this, click File > Download Zip. I have not made any new releases on the releases page with my edits for AvaCrypt, all releases on that page are just old version of Poiyomi.

This is a fork of the Poiyomi Toon Shader maintained specifically for use with the `GeoTetra AvaCrypt` avatar encryption system. 

If you are not using AvaCrypt, this fork serves no purpose for you. Please make use of the original repo here: https://github.com/poiyomi/PoiyomiToonShader
